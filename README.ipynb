    "# Classification Project: Predicting Cardiovascular Disease\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author:** Ron Lodetti Jr.\n",
    "![Heart](./images/heart.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "***\n",
    "This project uses machine learning and data from the CDC's [2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2021.html) to help a hospital target patience who would benefit from an educational program about heart health. After model iteration and hyperparameter tuning, our final model can correctly predict 81% of people with a heart condition, while only incorrectly predicting 28% of negative cases as positive. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "***\n",
    "Cardiovascular diseases are the [leading cause of death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate) worldwide except Africa. A hospital wants to be able to identify patients who are at risk of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) to begin taking preventative measures as early as possible. The hospital has developed a new online educational program and would like to recommend it to any patience at risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Understanding\n",
    "***\n",
    "This dataset, [from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alphiree/cardiovascular-diseases-risk-prediction-dataset), is a cleaned version of the responses from the CDC's [2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2021.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, we have 308,854 rows, each with 18 feature columns and 1 target column:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `General_Health`: Respondent's reported general health\n",
    "* `Checkup`: Time since respondent's last routine checkup\n",
    "* `Exercise`: Participation in any physical activities or exercises in the past month\n",
    "* `Heart_Disease`: **(Target)** Respondents that reported having coronary heart disease or myocardial infarction\n",
    "* `Skin_Cancer`: Respondents that reported having skin cancer\n",
    "* `Other_Cancer`: Respondents that reported having any other types of cancer\n",
    "* `Depression`: Respondents that reported having a depressive disorder\n",
    "* `Diabetes`: Respondents that reported having a diabetes\n",
    "* `Arthritis`: Respondents that reported having an Arthritis\n",
    "* `Sex`: Respondent's Gender\n",
    "* `Age_Category`: Respondent's Age, by category\n",
    "* `Height_(cm)`: Respondent's Height in centimeters\n",
    "* `Weight_(kg)`: Respondent's Weight in kilograms\n",
    "* `BMI`: Body Mass Index\n",
    "* `Smoking_History`: Respondents that reported having a history of smoking cigarettes\n",
    "* `Alcohol_Consumption`: Number of days, in the past 30 days, where respondent has had at least one alcoholic beverage\n",
    "* `Fruit_Consumption`: Number of servings of fruit during the past 30 days\n",
    "* `Green_Vegetables_Consumption`: Number of servings of vegetables during the past 30 days\n",
    "* `FriedPotato_Consumption`: Number of servings of fruit during the past 30 days\n",
    "\n",
    "Of our 12 categorical variables:\n",
    "* There are 8 variables that have no order to them and will need to be OneHotEncoded.\n",
    "* There are 3 ordinal variables, that is, categories which have an order. These include `General_Health`, `Checkup`, and `Age_Category`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![target_imbalance](./images/viz_1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our target variable is very imbalanced. We'll need to be sure to address this during data prep, modeling and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a visual representation illustrating the disparity in heart disease rates between individuals with a specific feature and those without it. For instance, approximately 6.06% of individuals without diabetes report experiencing a heart condition, whereas the rate is approximately 20.85% for those with diabetes, resulting in a substantial difference of approximately 14.79%.\n",
    "![rate_change](./images/viz_2.jpg)\n",
    "- People with most of these features are more likely to also have Heart Disease\n",
    "- Men are more likely to report having Heart Disease than women\n",
    "- Exercise is the only feature listed that has a negative relationship with Heart Disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Modeling\n",
    "***\n",
    "Since our stakeholder wants to identify as many people as possible who could have a heart condition and the cost of a false positive (identifying a person as likely to have a heart condition when they will not) is low, then we should prioritize the true positive rate, or recall. Given the imbalance in our dataset, I will use the f2-score as my evaluation metric. \n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple different classification algorithms were explored- logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, a basic Decision Tree, and Random Forest models were investigated, tuned, and evaluated. The F1 score was the primary metric used for evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many models were used, tuned and scored before deciding to go with an XGBClassifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that this data is from a questionare, feature importance relates to questions being asked.\n",
    "![feature_importance](./images/feature_importance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
    "***\n",
    "Now that we have found the final model, I will score each of our models on the test data. \n",
    "\n",
    "![test_scores](./images/test_scores.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model was the best performing model on the test data, capturing almost 81% of all of the positive cases. Given the over 300,000 data entries, lack of data leakage, and cross-validation done during training, I'm confident that this model would generalize. \n",
    "\n",
    "![confusion_matrix](./images/confusion_matrix.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this confusion matrix our model would correctly predict 81% of positive cases and 72% of negative cases. It would incorrectly predict 28% of negative cases as positive and 19% of positive cases as negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "- Based on our final model I would recommend that the hospital develop a questionaire to get information about their patience for all features except weight. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- This model would not be as helpful in cases where the cost of a positve identification is increased, such as recommending a more invasive procedure, medication, or otherwise more expenive or cumbersome consequence.  \n",
    "- It may be difficult to gather 17 pieces of information about patients. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "- Determine with stakeholders which questions to include based on their feature importance, ease of retrieving that data, and cost of excluding that data from the model\n",
    "- Determine with stakeholders the appropriate threshold to balance out true positive rate and false positive rate.\n",
    "- Gather more data to see if there are other features which may help predict having a heart condition.\n",
